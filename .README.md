# Gitmoji control version

-  https://docs.gitmoji-changelog.dev/#/

Here the recommended workflow to generate your changelog file using gitmoji-changelog:

Important: Before generating, be sure to have all tags locally (e.g. git fetch origin)

- Make changes and commit: git commit -m ":sparkles: my awesome feature"
- Bump version (ex: 1.0.0) in package.json using semver convention
- Run gitmoji-changelog, then the file CHANGELOG.md is created or updated with all changes
- You can freely edit the new release in the changelog file, it will not be overwritten with the next generation
- Commit package.json and CHANGELOG.md file
- Tag your release: git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0" (or create a Github release)
- Push to the remote git push --follow-tags
